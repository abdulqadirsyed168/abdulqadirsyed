CONSISTENCY
AVAILABILITY
PARTITION TOLERANCE

CAP THEOREM SAYS WE CAN ONLY ACHIEVE TWO PROPERTIES FROM DATABASE

CONSISTENCY:
             NOT ONLY ONE USER WILL READ AND WRITE DATA FROM DATA TABLE THERE WILL BE N NUMBER OF USERS WILL BE PERFORM READ AND WRITE OPERATIONS SO FOR ALL OF THEM 
             DATA NEED TO GIVE 100% OUTPUT IT IS CALLED AS CONSISTENCY. EXAMPLE: BANK TRANSACTIONS
             
AVAILABILITY:
              IF THEIR IS ANY FAILURE WILL HAPPEN ACROSS NODES NOT ONLY NODES ACROSS SYSTEM IT WILL NEED TO PROVIDE BACKUP AND REPLICATIONS WILL NEED IT 
              IT CALLED AVAILABILITY.
              
PARTITION TOLERANCE:
                     DATA SHOULD BE SPLIT ACROSS THE NODES FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN CONSIDER HADOOP NAME NODE AND DATA NODE
