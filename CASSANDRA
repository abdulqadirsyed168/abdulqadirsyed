IT WAS DEVELOPED BY FACEBOOK
IT CAME AS OPEN SOURCE PROJECT UNDER APACHE 3.0 , 3.25
CASSANDRA IS NOT MADE FOR ANALYTICAL QUERIES
WE CAN PERFOME JOIN AND AGGREGATION ETC
IT IS BENFIT FOR FASTER WRITE OPERATION
IT IS BENFIT FOR FASTER READ SERACH OPERATION
CASSANDRA WILL FOLLOW RING KIND OF ARCHITECTURE NOT MASTER SLAVE ARCHITECTURE



* CASSANDRA COMPONENTS
NODE
CLUSTER
READ REQUEST LANDED ON SOME NODE IT BECOME COORDINATER NODE

NODE- WHERE DATA STORE
CLUSTER- COMBINATION OF NODES
DATA CENTERS- LARGE LOCATION OR AREA TO CONTAIN NODES
COORDINATER- HANDLES CURRENT READ WRITE REQUEST
COMMIT&LOG- EVERY WRITE OPERATION IS WRITTEN TO COMMIT LOG, COMMIT LOG IS USED FOR CRASH RECOVERY
MEM TABLE- AFTER DATA WRITTEN IN COMMIT LOG DATA WILL BE WRITTEN IN MEM TABLE. DATA IS WRITTEN FOR TEMPORARY BASES
SS TABLE- WHEN MEM-TABLE REACHES A CERTIAN THERSHOLD DATA IS FLUSHED INTO SS TABLE DISK.

CASSANDRA WILL PLACES REPLICAS OF DATA ON DIFFERENT NODES BASED ON TWO FACTORS

1 WHERE TO PLACE NEXT REPLICA IS DETERMINED BY REPLICATION STRATERGY
2 WHILE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF REPLICAS PLACED ON DIFFERENT NODES IF DETERMINED BY REPLICATION FACTOR

REPLICATION FACTOR = HOW MANY NUMBER OF COPIES WILL BE CREATED THAT IS KNOW AS REPLICATION FACTOR

REPLICATION STRATERGY:
TWO TYPES OF REPLICATION STRATERGY
1 SIMPLE STRATERGY
2 NETWORK TOPOLOGY STRATERGY

1 SIMPLE STRATERGY:
* IT WILL BE USED WHEN WILL HAVE ONLY ONE DATA CENTER.
* FIRST COPY WILL BE CREATED ON THE COORDINATOR NODE AND AFTER THAT REMAIMING COPIES WILL BE CREATED IN OTHER NODES IN CLOCK WISE DIRECTION.

2 NETWORK TOPOLOGY STRATERGY:
* IT WILL BE USED WHEN WILL HAVE MORE THAN ONE DATA CENTER.
* REPLICAS ARE SET FOR EACH DATA CENTRE SEPARATELY.
* NETWORK TOPOLOGY PLACES REPLICAS IN CLOCKWISE DIRECTION IN THE RING UNTIL IT REACHES THE FIRST NODE IN ANOTHER DATA CENTER.
