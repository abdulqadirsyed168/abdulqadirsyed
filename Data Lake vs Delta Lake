Delta lake accepts structure,semi,unstruct data
Delta lake simplify lambda architecture for batch + streaming combination


Delta lake Internal Working Mechanism

For Every 10 Json transaction log file, it will create on checkpointing called as Parquet checkpointing log file, It is help full for unnessecarry scanings
