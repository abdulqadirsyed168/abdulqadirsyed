ETL - EXTRACT TRANSFORM LOAD
ELT - EXTRACT LOAD TRANSFORM - LOADED AT DATA LAKE
WHILE COMPARE BETWEEN ETL/ELT, ELT WOULD BE BETTER FOR OTHER TEAMS TO GET DATA WITHOUT ANY TRANSFORMATION 
DATA SCIENCETIS, DATA ENGINEERING, DATA ANALYTICS TEAMS CAN GET DATA IN DATA LAKE

# DATA LAKE - ANY SYSTEM TOOL/FILE SYSTEM WHERE WE KEEP ALL THE DATA COMMING FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES AND DIFFERENT FORMATS
EX : STRUCTURED,UN-STRUCTURED,SEMI-STRUCTURED

Q WHAT SYSTEM CAN HOLD THIS KIND OF MASSIVE DATA ?
Ans HDFS,AWS-S3,AZURE-BLOB,GCP-STORAGE WHERE WE CAN HOLD PETA BYTES OF DATA IN ANY FORMAT.

# DATA WAREHOUSE - ANY SYSTEM/TOOLS/FRAME WORKS WHICH HOLDS TRANSFORMED DATA WILL BE KNOW AS DATA WAREHOUSE,IT REPRESENTS DATA IN ONLY STRUCTURE FORM LIKE ROW/COLUMN
EX : HIVE,AWS-REDSHIFT,SNOWFLAKE

# DATA MART - CATEGORIE LEVEL SEPARATION INSIDE A DATA WARE HOUSE IS KNOW AS DATA-MART
EX - FINANCIAL DEPT,
     HR DEPT,
     EMPLOYEE DEPT CATEGORIE LEVEL SEPARATION
     
# DENORMALIZED :-
                 FOR EXAMPLE TABLE EMPID,EMP_NAME DEPT_NAME
                 IF WE NEED TO UPDATE DPET_NAME WEE NEED TO UPDATE ALL RECORDS
                 DENORMALIZATION USED FOR BEST ANALYTICAL QUERIES
                 
# NORMALIZED :- 
                FOR EXAMPLE TABLE EMP_ID,EMP_NAME,DEPT_ID MAKE A JOIN WITH DEPT TABLE DEPT_ID,DEPT_NAME
                IF WE NEED TO UPDATE DEPT_NAME AUTOMATICLY IT WILL REFELCT TO OTHER TABLE ONLY ONCE UPDATE REQUIRED
                NORMALIZATION NOT BEST FOR ANALYTICAL QUERIES BECAUSE JOINS HAVING COSTLY'S OPERATION.

     
# OLT(ONLINE TRANSACTION PROCESSING) :-
                                       SYSTEM DESIGN TO SUPPORT TRANSACTION LEVEL OPERATIONS LIKE INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE, THEY SUPPORT ACID PROPERTIES AND MAIN GOAL IS TO
                                       CAPTURE DATA IN REAL TIME. IN OLTP DATA RESIDES IN ITS NORMALIZED FORM
                                       EX:- RDBMS,MYSQL,ORACLE,POSTGRE SQL.
                                       THEY ARE NOT MENT FOR ANALYTICAL QUERIES 
                                       
# OLAP(ONLINE ANALYTICAL PROCESSING) :-
                                     IT IS DESIGN TO SUPPORT ANALYTICAL QUERIES, IT KEEPS DATA IN DENORMALIZED FORM AND DOEST CARE ABOUT ACID PROPERTIES MAIN GOAL IS TO 
                                     HELP USERS TO QUERY HISTORICAL DATA AND GET INSIDE OUT OF IT
                                     EX:- REDSHIFT,HIVE,NO-SQL,SNOWFLAKE.
                                     
                                     
* IMPORTANT TERMINOLOGY IN DATAWAREHOUSING :-
1 DIMENSION TABLE
2 FACT TABLE
3 RELATIONSHIP
4 STAR SCHEMA
5 SNOW FLAKE SCHEMA

1 DIMENSION TABLES : 
* IT CONTAINS DIMENSIONS OF FACT
* DIMENSION TABLE WILL JOIN WITH FACT TABLE USEING FOREIGN KEYS
* DIMENSION TABLES ARE DENORMALIZED IN NATURE
* DIMENSION TABLE ACTUALLY IT OFFERED DESCRIPTIVE CHARACTERSTIC OF THE FACT WITH THE HELP OF ATTRIBUTES

2 FACT TABLES :
* FACT TABLES CONTAINS THOSE NUMERICAL ATTRIBUTES WHICH HELP TO DERIVE MEANING FULL VALUES
* IT HOLDS FOREIGN KEY OF DIMENSION TABLE 

3 STAR SCHEMA :
* IN THIS STAR SCHEMA ONE OR MORE FACT TABLES WILL THERE AND THEY CAN BE CONNECT ANY NUMBER OF DIMENSION TABLES
