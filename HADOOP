Q. WHAT IS FILE SYSTEM ?
Ans. FILE SYSTEM IS USE TO READ AND WRITE DATA INTO HARD DISK
EXAMPLE : IF WE HAVE INSTALLED WINDOWS SYSTEM AND THE OS INSTALLED (NTFS) "New Technology File System", NTFS was first introduced in 1993
        : IF WE HAVE INSTALLED LINUX SYSTEM AND THE OS INSTALLED (EXT) “Extended File System”, 
        : IF WE HAVE INSTALLED MAC SYSTEM AND THE OS INSTALLED (HFS) "Hierarchical File System " 
        : IF WE HAVE MOBILE THEY ALSO HAVE OWN FILE SYSTEM
        
Q. WHAT IS BLOCK ?
ANS. * IF WE NEED TO STORE 1GB OF DATA IN ANY MACHINE 
     * 1GB OF DATA WILL GET DIVIED INTO SMALL SMALL CHUKS AS BLOCKS 
     Q. WHY USING SMALL SMALL CHUNKS?
     Ans. TO SPEEDUP READ AND WRITE OPERATIONS
     BLOCK FOR NTFS - 16KB
     BLOCK FOR EXT - 512KB
     BLOCK FOR HDFS - 128MB HIGHLY CONFIGURABLE ACCORDING TO VOLUME OF DATA
     
 Q. CLIENT AND SERVER ?
 Ans. CLIENT SEND REQUEST
      SERVER SEND RESPONSE TO CLIENT
      EX : FACEBOOK LOG IN TO ANY SYSTEM(CLIENT) TO SERVER AND SERVER GIVING RESPONSE TO CLIENT
      
 Q. TYPES OF FILESYSTEM ?
 Ans. # STAND ALONE FILESYSTEM :- WHAT EVER DATA GETTING STORE IN MACHINE AND IT WILL NOT SHARE ACROSS OTHER MACHINES THEN ITS STAND ALONE FILESYSTEM
      # DISTRIBUTED FILESYSTEM :- WHAT EVER DATA GETTING STORE IN MACHINE AND IT WILL BE SHARE ACROSS TO OTHER MACHNIES THEN ITS DISTRIBUTED FILESYSTEM
      
Q. DISTRIBUTED TYPES ?
Ans # MASTER AND SLAVE :- HADOOP,SPARK,HBASE [SPOF-SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE - SPOC-SINGLE POINT OF COMMUNICATION]
    # PEER TO PEER :- CASSANDRA
    
Q. WHAT IS PROCESS :- POGRAMMING IN EXECUTION

Q. CLUSTER - GROUP OF NODES
   NODE - INDIVIDUAL PHYSICAL OR VIRTUAL MACHINE
   
Q. API- APPLICATION POGRAMM INTERFACE - A PROCESS WHICH PREOCCED YOUR REQUEST
   EX:- WANT TO SEE MOVIE MEDIA PLAYER IS API
   


*2002 Goggle has introduced GFS File  system to read and write data from disk
*Before reading data the data we get  distributed across the nodes
*2004 Goggle has released another paper  called GMR this is for processing
*2005-2006 DOUG CUTTING has introduced  hadoop
*Hadoop- Comes HDFS and MR
*Hadoop Framework- Comes HDFS MR and  diffrent companies and different  individual and communities has improve  Hadoop
*HIVE was invented by FACEBOOK to improve Performance of Mapreduce in SQL language
*PIG was invented by YAHOOH and they dont  want to interact with Mapreduce with any  kind pogramming language so they will use  Scripting language PIGLATIN LANGUAGE.
*Internaly HIVE and PIG will run as  Mapreduce in java
*SQOOP was invented by group of companies
 SQOOP will do Import and Export of data  from hadoop to RDBMS and RDBMS to hadoop
*SQOOP will internaly run on java it will   some SQOOP commands
*OOZIE is a scheduler was invented by  YAHOOH 
*Map reduce is an upstraction of  HIVE,PIG,SQOOP,OOZIE
*HBASE was invented by FACEBOOK its an NOSQLdatabase 
*MAHOOT its used by DATASCIENCE
*FLUME is to connect any kind of data  bases,urls,twitter,facebook only Import  data from database to hadoop
*LOSELY COUPLED FRAMEWORK
*TIGHTLY COUPLED FRAMEWORK
*HDFS and HBASE is Storagepart
*MR,HIVE,PIG is Processing data
*SQOOP,FLUME is Pipeline of data
*OOZIE is scheduler
*MAHOOT is data science related
