* Hive is query engine
* Hive is an vehical which upon running on  MapReduce engine OR Spark engine
* Hive is an upstraction of MapReduce
* Hive internaly use MapReduce Instead of  Java it using SQL
* Spark is just replacement of MapReduce  not entire Hadoop system
* Hive have Meta data information

# Meta data Example:
While we create Table Hive will have only schema information not a data in the table
How many cloumns weather it have index or not.

Q. Where will Hive Metadata information is   store?
Ans. Hive will store Metadata infromation in  RDBMS,ORACLE,MYSQL...etc it called as REMOTE METASTORE MECHANISM.

*Hive internally have DURBY which stores  the Metadata Information and it called as  EMBADED METASTORE MECHANISM.

EMBADED METASTORE-
Mostly embaded metastore will not use
Becauses it will save Durby metastore to an each node

Q. WHY WE ARE NOT USING DURBY IN HIVE ?
Ans SUPPOSE WE HAVE FOUR NODES EACH NODE WILL HAVE THEIR OWN DURBY DATABASE
    IF WE NEED TO CREATE TABLE WITH NAME OF TEST AND OUT OF FOUR NODE ONE NODE HAS CREATED TABLE AND SCHEMA HAS BEEN INSTALLED IN NODE OF THE DURBY
    IF WE NEED TO INSERT RECORDS TO THAT TABLE THEN OUT OF FOUR NODES FIRST NODE HAVE PICKUP THE INSERT COMMAND AND IT WILL GIVE AN ERROR TABLE NOT FOUND
    SO IN BETWEEN THE NODES OF INDIVIDUAL DURBY WILL NOT SHARE THE META DATA INFORMATION ACROSS THE NODES 
    SO DURBY DATABASE WILL NOT HIGH RECOMMANDABLE.
