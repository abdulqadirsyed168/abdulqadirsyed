How do you handle duplicate records in a table and delete records in SQL? 
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT column1, column2, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY column1, column2 ORDER BY id_column) AS row_num
    FROM table_name
)
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE id_column IN (
    SELECT id_column FROM CTE WHERE row_num > 1
);
