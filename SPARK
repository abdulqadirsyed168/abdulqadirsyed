# DRAWBACKS FOR HADOOP :-
IT WAS MADE BY BATCH PROCESSING
SLOW PROCESSING BECAUSE NOT IN MEMEORY COMPUTATION
NO FAULT TOLERANT IN TERMS OF COMPUTATION 
NO MECHANISM FOR CACHING,PERSISTANCE ETC...

# COMPONENTS OF HADDOP:-
1. HDFS
2. MAD-REDUCE
3. YARN-YET ANOTHER RESOURCE NEGOTITOR.

# APACHE SPARK :-
IT IS DISTRIBUTED COMPUTATION FRAMEWORK
IT DOES NOT HAVE ANY SEPARATED STORAGE OR FILE SYSTEM

# FEATURES OF SPARK :-
1. SPEED : SPARK IS 100 TIME FASTER THAN HADOOP
2. POWERFUL CACHING : CAPABILITIES TO PERSIST DATA INMEMORY
3. DEPLOYMENT : FOR HADOOP DEPLOYMENT WILL HANDEL BY YARN WHILE IN SPARK DEPLOYMENT WOULD HANDEL BY OTHER RESOURCE MANAGER CAN ALSO WORK WITH SPARK
   * YARN
   * MESOS
   * KUBERNETES
   * SPARK OWN CLUSTER MANAGER
   
4. GOOD FIT FOR BATCH AND REAL TIME PROCESSING
5. POLYGLOT :- SPARK PROVIDED HIGH LEVEL API'S ON LIBRARIES FOR DIFFERENT LANGUAGES LIKE 
               * PYTHON
               * JAVA
               * SCALA
               * R
